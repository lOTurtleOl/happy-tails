            <h1>Dog Boarding</h1>
            <p>At Family Pet Resort, we are an all-inclusive all-suites resort that provides everything for your pet
                during their stay with us. We are happy to provide every guest with plush beding and plenty of toys, so
                there's no need to bring any from home. We proudly serve Canidae brand Low Residue dog food; however, if
                you choose to provide your own food, please provide pre-measured baggies with feeding instructions. For
                those dogs with a sweet tooth, ice cream treats and biscuites are available, as well as gourmet stuffed
                kong treats.</p>
            <p>What do you have in mind when you think o a typical boarding kennel? You will not find a more elite
                kennel in Pennsylvania. Please come in and visit us and see for yourself what sets our family friendly
                resort apart from the other kennels. Our canine accommodations offer all the services you would expect
                from a five-star resort including room service, maid service, soothing usic and clean & comfortable
                climate-controlled suites. Our state of the art facilities also exchange fresh air throughout the resort
                approximately 6 to 8 times per hour.</p>
            <p>Luxury Suites start from only $32.00 per night.</p>
            <p>Contact us about our Ultra Luxury Vacation Villas that include TV's and our Oversized Family Suites for
                families with multiple pets.</p>
